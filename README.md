# Console-Finances

## Week 4 challenge

In this challenge, I'll be using the concepts I've learned to complete a real-world situation in which my newfound JavaScript skills will come in handy. I am tasked with creating code for analyzing the financial records of a company. I have been provided with a financial dataset in the starter/index.js file.

## Acceptance criteria

1. Create a new GitHub repo called Console-Finances. Then, clone it to your computer.

2. Copy the starter files in your local git repository.

You have been given a dataset composed of arrays with two fields, Date and Profit/Losses.
Your task is to write JavaScript code that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

- The total number of months included in the dataset.

- The net total amount of Profit/Losses over the entire period.

- The average of the changes in Profit/Losses over the entire period.

  - You will need to track what the total change in profits are from month to month and then find the average.
  - (Total/Number of months)

- The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period.

- The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period.

When you open your code in the browser your resulting analysis should look similar to the following:

```text
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 25
Total: $2561231
Average  Change: $-2315.12
Greatest Increase in Profits: Feb-2012 ($1926159)
Greatest Decrease in Profits: Sep-2013 ($-2196167)
```

When you open the console you will be able to see the resulting analysis. I have also made a html file which has the JS values linked and displays them in a simple container.
